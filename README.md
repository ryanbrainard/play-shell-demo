Play Shell Demo
===============

When developing and managing an application, it can sometimes be helpful to be able to execute commands within the
context of the live application. This could be used for testing application behavior or working with the models and database.
Similar to `rails console` in Ruby, the [`play-shell` module](https://github.com/grandfatha/play-shell),
can launch a Play! application within an interactive `groovysh` shell. Combined with Heroku's ability to run one-off processes,
running `heroku run play shell` launches a new dyno and starts up a `groovysh` console in the context of the application.

Setup
-----
This demo application has already been configured with the `play-shell` module, but to follow these steps to add it to your own application:

1. Add the `play-shell` module as a Git submodule in your project
`git submodule add git://github.com/grandfatha/play-shell.git vendor/play-shell`

2. Update your `dependecies.yml`


        require:
            - play
            - play-shell -> play-shell
    
        repositories:
            - vendored-modules:
                type: local
                artifact: ${application.path}/vendor/[module]
                contains:
                    - play-shell


3. Run `play dependecies` to install the module.


heroku run play shell
---------------------
After pushing the changes to Heroku, run `heroku run play shell` to launch the `groovysh` shell.

In the example below, a new `Post` is created. Once the transaction is commited, the new Post can be viewed in the web application.

    => heroku run play shell
